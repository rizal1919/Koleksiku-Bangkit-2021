 What is Google Cloud or Cloud Computing
=========================================
- First, Computing resources on-demand and self service. We just operate the interface and we'll get the processing power, storage, and network we need
- Second, We can access over internet from anywhere we are.
- Third, The provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool.
  Allows provider to get economics of scale by buying in bulk and pass the savings on the customers
  Customers dont have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources
- Fourth, the resources are elastic. If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less, you can scale back.
- Fifth, the customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

 What is IaaS, PaaS, Saas?
============================
IaaS
- Services provides underlying architecture to run servers.
- The resources to run are provided but its up to users to managed the operating system and the application
- Provide raw compute, storage, network organized
- pay for what you allocates

PaaS
- Takes it one step further
- the entire environment will managed for you the users
- all we need to do just managed the application
- the operating systems layer will be managed as a services
- bind application code you write to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs
- we just focus on our application logic
- pay for what you use

Saas
- The infrastructure, platform, and the software are managed for customers
- All we need to do just bring data to the systems
- Gmail, Docs, Search

=============================
 What are Regions and Zones?
=============================
- Zones are where we deployed our aplication or servers in gcp. 
- Zones is not a google data center cause its not corresponding to one physical building
- Zones are group of region
- and the application that runs in zones within region can have a fast connection and low latency
- region is individual geographic area
